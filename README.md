# AI-Research on Sentiment Analysis Hotel Review

## Introduction
This repository hosts my research project on hotel reviews using different NLP techniques. Our focus is to find the best combination of feature extraction methods and
modeling techniques.

## Dataset
Datasets comes from [Kaggle Trip Advisor Hotel Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/trip-advisor-hotel-reviews) and [Kaggle Booking Hotel Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michelhatab/hotel-reviews-bookingcom)

## Model
My approach employs different feature extraction methods and modeling techniques, including Word2Vec, TF-IDF, GloVe, Logistic Regression, Deep Learning, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

### Experiments
A total of seven experiments were conducted, including 
- Word2Vec + Logistic Regression
- Word2Vec + Deep Learning
- TFIDF + Logistic Regression
- TFIDF + Deep Learning
- TFIDF + CNN
- GloVe.6B + Logistics Regression
- GloVe.6B + LSTM

### Recognition Process
The model's development involved several key stages:
- **Data Acquisition**: Gathering images of hand gestures.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, encoding, labeling, split, tokenization, and augmentation. 
- **Model Training**: Training model based on Tripadvisor dataset. 
- **Model Evaluation**:  Testing for accuracy. 
- **Robustness Testing**: Evaluating robustness based on the Booking dataset.
